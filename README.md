Business Understanding Overview

Background Information: Working as a data scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company. You have been tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time.

Assumptions: (1) The dataset contains data collected for a period of 9 days. 

Business Objectives: Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.

Business Success Criteria: (1) Identifying the most popular hour for returning cars (2) Recommending what station is the most popular overall, and at the most popular picking hour (3) What postal code is the most popular for picking up Blue cars, and whether the most popular station belongs to that postal code overall, and at the most popular picking hour. (4) Whether the results change if you consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Blue cars.

Data Understanding

Involves accessing the data and exploring it using tables and graphics that can be organized using the Crisp-DM project tool, enabling you to determine the quality of the data and describe the results of these steps in the project documentation.
